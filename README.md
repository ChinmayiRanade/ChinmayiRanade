ðŸŽ¯ **Featured Project: Predicting Happiness with Machine Learning**  
**What I Did:** Analyzed the World Happiness Report dataset to predict the 'Life Ladder' score using features like GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy.  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest Regressors  
**Results:** Achieved robust model performance with RMSE and RÂ² as evaluation metrics, outperforming baseline models. Explored feature importance to provide actionable insights.
